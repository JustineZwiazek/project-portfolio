Requirements:

- The page should be built with HTML and CSS (JS if needed)
- You should use CSS Grid or Flexbox for layout
- The page should be fully responsive (mobile, tablet and desktop)
- The page should look and function the same on Chrome, Firefox, and Edge.
- The page should work well for people that use screen readers and keyboard navigation.
- The HTML code should validate in a validation tool.

Approach:
I worked extensilvely on the HTML before starting with CSS. It is perhaps a bit more chaotic than my previous projects - I definitely struggled with keeping it as "miniimal code" and still passing the browser and accessibility requirements. I hope with practice it will become easier. It was fun following the design, and I added some styling to make it a bit catching visually.
